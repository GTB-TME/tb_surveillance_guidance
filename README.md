# tb_surveillance_guidance

Supplementary files used in Web Annex C of the 2023 edition of the WHO guidance document on TB surveillance

The _tb_register.csv_ and _laboratory_register.csv_ files are based on the Link Plus (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/tools/registryplus/lp.htmsimulation) test data files. They were modified extensively to simulate TB data files commonly found in many low income countries. 

The _tb_deduplication.csv_ file was created specifically by the WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme for the purpose of deduplication exercises.
